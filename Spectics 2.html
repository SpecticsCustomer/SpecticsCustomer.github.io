<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using new micro-OLED technology, your Spectics can supply extreme contrast and a blisteringly fast refresh rate without wasting battery. Your Spectics use bleeding edge technology, utilizing eye tracking to make your Spectics more power efficient by slightly blurring what you arenâ€™t looking at, while also allowing you to set a retina-based login so that your personal data is much harder to steal. The built-in gyroscope of the glasses makes it so they can effectively render three-dimensional objects and keep them in the same place, like a keyboard or a virtual pet. The cameras in the lenses of the Spectics 2 are even better at hand tracking then before, offering almost zero lag on exact hand positioning for precise gestures.</p>
