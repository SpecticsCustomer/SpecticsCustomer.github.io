<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our new "Relax Mode" comes free with the Spectics 2 Pros and makes a playlist on your favorite music app of relaxing music based on your responses to a simple survey. Spectics 2 Pros support another of "Relax Mode"s features which is the capability to change the theme to a lower brightness and increase the volume slightly.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using new micro-OLED technology, our Pros can supply extreme contrast, blisteringly fast refresh rates, and all without any wasted light. Our app uses bleeding edge technology to use eye tracking to make our Spectics more power efficient by slightly blurring what you arenâ€™t looking at, while also allowing you to set a retina-based login so that your personal data is much harder to steal. The built-in gyroscope of the glasses makes it so they can effectively render three-dimensional objects and keep them in the same place, like a keyboard or a virtual pet. The cameras in the lenses of the Spectics 2 Pros are even better at hand tracking then before, offering almost zero lag on exact hand positioning, as they immediately delete any footage automatically (there is a setting to keep it for those who want high security on their day to day lives), there is no risk of privacy loss, these cameras also allow for high quality photos that look exactly like what you see.</p>
